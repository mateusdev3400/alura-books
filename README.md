# Alura Books

## About

This application's main objective is to combine my knowledge of styling and manipulating elements and positioning with flexbox, but not only that, it can be noted that it comes with a range of responsiveness throughout the page, starting from the header, main and footer.

At the top we can already see that there is a menu for when the device used is a cell phone, and a menu for when the device is a desktop or tablet. In addition to responsiveness throughout the banner, carousel, card, topics and newsletter.
